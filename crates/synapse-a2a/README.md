synapse-a2a is an in-memory registry of agent-to-agent ([A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org/))
agents. Services that host agents register them over HTTP or list them in a seed file;
clients discover them through a catalogue, fetch their agent cards, and resolve an agent id
to the URL where it serves A2A. The registry stores what it is given and hands it back: it
doesn't proxy A2A traffic.

The [synapse-gateway](https://crates.io/crates/synapse-gateway) binary serves the registry on
its API port (default `:8080`), seeded from `a2a.toml` when that file exists. This crate lets
you serve the same endpoints from your own axum application.

## Install

```bash
cargo add synapse-a2a
```

## Example

Share one registry between the admin and public routers, so registrations are visible to
discovery:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

use synapse_a2a::{a2a_admin_router, a2a_public_router, seed_from_path, A2aRegistry};

async fn app() -> anyhow::Result<axum::Router> {
    let registry = Arc::new(A2aRegistry::new());

    let seed = "config/a2a.toml";
    if std::path::Path::new(seed).exists() {
        seed_from_path(&registry, seed).await?;
    }

    Ok(axum::Router::new()
        .merge(a2a_admin_router(registry.clone()))
        .merge(a2a_public_router(registry)))
}
```

The routers serve:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/internal/a2a/agents` | Register an agent (first writer wins). |
| `DELETE` | `/internal/a2a/agents/{id}` | Remove an agent. |
| `GET` | `/.well-known/a2a-agent-catalog.json` | List the agents. |
| `GET` | `/a2a/agents/{id}/.well-known/agent-card.json` | One agent's card. |
| `GET` | `/a2a/agents/{id}/resolve` | One agent's endpoint and card. |

The `/internal/` endpoints have no authentication: serve them on a private listener, or block
them at your ingress.
