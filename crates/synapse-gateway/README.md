synapse-gateway is an open-source LLM gateway written in Rust. Your clients send standard
OpenAI `POST /v1/chat/completions` requests; the gateway routes each one through a
config-driven fallback chain of providers (Vertex AI, OpenAI, Qwen and self-hosted
OpenAI-compatible servers) and records what it cost in a per-tenant ledger. Requests travel
on one of three lanes: the standard OpenAI-compatible lane, a native Vertex AI lane that keeps
context caching, `gs://` media and strict response schemas, and a Jev lane for typed
decisions from TypeSafe System One. Streaming, tool calling, embeddings, input guardrails and
`synapse_*` metrics are built in.

## Install

```bash
# Docker image (linux/amd64)
docker pull sustentabilitas/synapse-gateway

# Binary
cargo install synapse-gateway
```

To embed the gateway in a Rust service, add the library without its default features and
call `Gateway::chat()` in-process (the library crate is named `synapse`):

```toml
[dependencies]
synapse-gateway = { version = "0.5", default-features = false }
```

See [Installation](https://synapse-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/get-started/installation/)
for Cargo features and ledger backends, and
[Embedding Synapse as a library](https://synapse-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/guides/embedding-as-library/).

## Example

Save a route and its prices:

```toml
# config/routes.toml
[routes."gemini-flash"]
legs = [
  { provider = "vertex", model = "gemini-3.5-flash-lite", region = "us" },
]
```

```toml
# config/pricing.toml
"vertex:gemini-3.5-flash-lite" = { input = 0.30, output = 2.50 }
```

Start the gateway with Application Default Credentials for Vertex AI, then send a request:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=my-gcp-project synapse-gateway   # API on :8080, metrics on :9090

# In a second terminal:
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-synapse-tenant: my-team" \
  -d '{"model": "gemini-flash", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

The [quickstart](https://synapse-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/get-started/quickstart/)
adds streaming, fallback to OpenAI, native Vertex requests and the cost ledger.
