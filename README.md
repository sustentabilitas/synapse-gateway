**The LLM gateway that keeps native power.** Synapse is an open-source Rust workspace: an
OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway with native Vertex AI and Jev routing lanes, plus a
reverse-proxy sidecar, an A2A agent registry and an on-demand MCP gateway.

## Crates

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`synapse-gateway`](crates/synapse-gateway) | OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway: fallback chains across providers, a native Vertex AI lane, Jev routing, streaming, tool calling, per-tenant cost ledger, input guardrails. |
| [`synapse-proxy`](crates/synapse-proxy) | Config-driven reverse-proxy sidecar: path-prefix routing, context injection, request/response transforms, streaming passthrough. |
| [`synapse-a2a`](crates/synapse-a2a) | In-memory agent-to-agent (A2A) registry with admin registration and public discovery, served by the gateway. |
| [`synapse-mcp`](crates/synapse-mcp) | On-demand MCP gateway library: per-server routing over Streamable HTTP with tenant identity injected from a shared context store. |
| [`synapse-context`](crates/synapse-context) | Shared context store (static base plus TTL overlay) used by `synapse-proxy` and `synapse-mcp`. |

## Quick start

Save a route and its prices in a `config/` folder:

```toml
# config/routes.toml
[routes."gemini-flash"]
legs = [
  { provider = "vertex", model = "gemini-3.5-flash-lite", region = "us" },
]
```

```toml
# config/pricing.toml
"vertex:gemini-3.5-flash-lite" = { input = 0.30, output = 2.50 }
```

Start the gateway with a Google Cloud service-account key (`sa.json`) that can call Vertex AI,
then send it a standard OpenAI request:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 9090:9090 \
  -e VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=my-gcp-project \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/secrets/sa.json \
  -v "$(pwd)/sa.json:/secrets/sa.json:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/config:/app/config" \
  sustentabilitas/synapse-gateway

# In a second terminal:
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-synapse-tenant: my-team" \
  -d '{"model": "gemini-flash", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

The [quickstart](https://synapse-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/get-started/quickstart/)
walks through streaming, fallback to OpenAI, native Vertex requests and the cost ledger.
