title: Fallback chains
description: How Synapse walks a route's legs when a provider fails, which failures move to the next leg on each lane, and how to design chains that fail over well.
---

Use a fallback chain whenever a single provider or region going down, throttling you or
timing out should not become an error for your users. A route lists several legs, and
Synapse tries them in order until one answers; the client sends one request and gets one
response, without knowing a leg failed. Chains also let you put a cheaper or faster model
first and keep a stronger one in reserve.

The keys are described in [Routes](../configuration/routes.md), and the
[fallback tutorial](../get-started/tutorials/fallback-across-providers.md) shows a chain
failing over from Vertex AI to OpenAI.

## The order of legs

- On a static route, the chain is the route's `legs`, in order.
- On a `strategy = "jev"` route, the chain starts with the chosen tier's legs, then each
  harder tier's, then each easier tier's. See [Jev router](jev-router.md#tier-fallback).
- Under lenient provider validation, legs whose provider cannot be built are removed at
  startup, and the chain is what remains. See
  [Providers](../configuration/providers.md#strict-and-lenient-validation).

Only one leg serves each request. Synapse never sends the same request to two legs at once.
Each leg gets exactly one attempt per request: chat requests have no retries on the same leg
and no circuit breakers, so a leg that is down is tried, and fails, on every request. See
[Limitations and roadmap](../reference/limitations-roadmap.md#resilience).

## What moves to the next leg

What counts as a failure depends on the lane serving the request and, on the standard lane,
on whether the client streams.

### Standard lane

For a **non-streaming** request, any failure moves to the next leg:

- an error response from the provider, including `4xx` errors such as an unknown model or an
  invalid API key;
- no first chunk within `SYNAPSE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`;
- a gap longer than `SYNAPSE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` between chunks;
- a stream that breaks or ends before the model finishes.

Synapse buffers each leg's whole response before sending anything, so even a leg that fails
half-way through is replaced cleanly by the next one.

For a **streaming** request, the same failures move to the next leg only until the first
chunk arrives. Synapse then commits to that leg and forwards chunks as they come; a later
failure ends the stream with an `error` event. See
[Streaming and tool calling](streaming-and-tools.md#fallback-while-streaming).

### Native Vertex lane

Requests with [native Vertex features](native-vertex.md) use only the route's `vertex`
legs, and are stricter about what they retry:

- A `5xx`, `429` or `408` response, a connection error or a timeout while opening the
  stream moves to the next `vertex` leg.
- Any other `4xx` stops the chain and returns `400` with Vertex's message. These errors,
  such as an invalid schema or an expired cache, would fail on every leg.
- Once Vertex AI accepts the request, Synapse is committed to that leg, for streaming and
  non-streaming clients alike. A failure after that point fails the request with `502` and
  error code `upstream_error`.

### Jev lane

Requests with a `jev` block try the route's `typesafe` legs first. A `429`, `408`, `5xx` or
connection error moves to the next one; any other error stops the request with `400`. When
every `typesafe` leg fails retryably, the route's other legs answer as a normal chat
completion. See [Jev lane](jev-lane.md#when-jev-fails).

### Embeddings

Embedding aliases try their legs in order. Any error moves to the next leg, and a leg whose
provider is not configured is skipped. See [Embeddings](embeddings.md#fallback).

## When every leg fails

| Lane | Response |
|---|---|
| Standard | `502` with error code `all_legs_failed` and a `failures` array naming each leg's provider, model and error message. |
| Native Vertex | `502` with error code `upstream_error` and the last leg's error. |
| Jev, no other legs | `502` with error code `all_legs_failed`. |

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "all_legs_failed",
    "code": "all_legs_failed",
    "message": "all legs of route 'chat' failed",
    "failures": [
      { "provider": "vertex", "model": "gemini-3.5-flash-lite", "message": "..." },
      { "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "message": "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

## What gets recorded

Only the leg that served the request is recorded: the ledger row, the response's `model`
field and the `model` label on `synapse_requests_total` all name it. Failed attempts are not
recorded, so tokens a provider consumed on a leg that broke mid-way do not appear in the
ledger. See [Cost ledger](cost-ledger.md#accuracy).

## Design a chain

- **Mix providers or regions.** Two legs on the same provider and region usually fail
  together. Put a different provider, or the same model in another region, behind the
  first leg.
- **Put the leg you want to pay for first.** Later legs only run when earlier ones fail, so
  order by preference, not by strength.
- **Keep native requests in mind.** A native Vertex request can only use `vertex` legs, so a
  route that serves them needs more than one `vertex` leg to fail over at all.
- **Test every leg on its own.** On the standard lane a misconfigured leg, such as a
  misspelled model name, fails over silently on every request, adding latency and hiding the
  problem. After changing models or credentials, call each leg through a single-leg route.
- **Size timeouts for the chain.** Each leg can use up to `SYNAPSE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`
  before the next one starts, so a three-leg chain can take three times as long to fail.
