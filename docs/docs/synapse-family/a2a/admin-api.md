description: Register and remove A2A agents at runtime through the gateway's /internal/a2a endpoints.
---

Agent hosts use the admin API to add their agents to the registry when they start, and to
remove them when they stop. The endpoints are on the gateway's API port.

:::warning
The admin endpoints have no authentication. Anyone who can reach them can remove an agent
and register another endpoint under its id. Allow `/internal/` only from the services that
register agents; see
[The A2A admin endpoints are open](../../operating/security.md#the-a2a-admin-endpoints-are-open).
:::

## `POST /internal/a2a/agents`

Registers an agent if its id isn't registered yet.

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/internal/a2a/agents \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @agent.json
```

```json
{
  "id": "invoice-agent",
  "name": "Invoice agent",
  "description": "Extracts line items from invoices",
  "endpoint_url": "https://agents.example.com/invoice",
  "card_url": "https://agents.example.com/invoice/.well-known/agent-card.json",
  "tags": ["finance"],
  "card": {
    "name": "Invoice agent",
    "description": "Extracts line items from invoices",
    "url": "https://agents.example.com/invoice",
    "version": "1.0",
    "skills": []
  },
  "ttl_seconds": 3600
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Yes | Registry key, used in the `/a2a/agents/{id}/...` paths. |
| `name` | string | Yes | Display name in the catalogue. |
| `description` | string | Yes | Short summary in the catalogue. |
| `endpoint_url` | string | Yes | Absolute URL where the agent serves A2A JSON-RPC. |
| `card_url` | string | Yes | Absolute URL of the agent's card, listed in the catalogue. |
| `tags` | array of strings | Yes | Free-form tags; send `[]` for none. |
| `card` | any JSON | Yes | The agent card, stored and served back unchanged. |
| `ttl_seconds` | integer | No | Seconds until the agent expires. Omit it for no expiry. |

The gateway stores the request as it is: it doesn't fetch `card_url` or check that the card
matches the other fields. Keep `card` a valid A2A agent card, because clients receive it
verbatim.

Returns `204 No Content`. A body that isn't JSON, or is missing a required field, is rejected
by the JSON parser with a `4xx` status before anything is registered.

### Duplicate ids

Registration is first-writer-wins. If the id is already registered, from the seed file or an
earlier `POST`, the request is ignored and still returns `204`. The existing entry, and its
expiry, are kept. To replace an agent, delete it first:

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE localhost:8080/internal/a2a/agents/invoice-agent
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/internal/a2a/agents -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @agent.json
```

An expired agent is only removed the next time the catalogue is listed or the agent is looked
up. Until then, a `POST` with its id is still treated as a duplicate. An agent host that
re-registers on a timer should therefore always `DELETE` before it `POST`s.

## `DELETE /internal/a2a/agents/{id}`

Removes the agent. Returns `204 No Content` whether or not the id was registered, so it is
safe to call on every shutdown.
